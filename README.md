Analysis, classification and search engine for Stanford Dogs Dataset

The extraction of features is an important step in
the process of image classification, as it allows the system to
identify and extract the most relevant information from an
image. The features that are extracted are used to represent
the image and are used as inputs for the classification algorithm.
The quality and relevance of the features extracted can greatly
affect the performance of the classification algorithm. This paper
presents a method for classifying dog breeds using the Stanford
Dogs Dataset, as well as an image search engine. The method
proposed utilizes the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) approach,
where SIFT and ORB algorithms are employed to identify unique
descriptors. These descriptors are then used to determine the
”visual words” that will be input into a K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier. Additionally, the same features are utilized to create
an image search engine based on cosine similarity. The proposed
method was compared to another method that used statistical
moments and co-occurrence matrix to extract features.
